Gaussian Naive Bayes is a very efficient method, especially for high dimensional problem. Decision tree classifier is very easy and straighforward to understand and explain. Support vector machines is very effective in high dimensional problem and can be generalized for not linear separable cases. The student data here can be very high dimensional data when we have much more data points. The model interpretability also need to be considered since we may need to explain to the board of directors. So many features describing the student may lead to a complex decision boundary.\n",

Decision tree based models, such as random forecast and xgboost, play an important role in today's machine learning task. Most of the kaggle wining solutions use xgboost as an important component of their algorithm.\n",

    "*pros*: The idea is simple yet powerful. Decision tree models have the ability to handle both categorical and numerical features without some feature preprocessing. It is very flexible and can be modified into more sophisticated machine learning methods, such as random forecast, gradient boosted trees and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "*cons*: The decision tree model can create over-complex trees that overfit the data. The decision tree model can also be unstable, in which a small variation in the data can lead to different tree being generated. Learning a optimal tree is a NP-hard problem. We need to rely on some algorithm (e.g. greedy method) to find the local optimal value at each step, which of course can not guarantee the global optimality.\n",

When the feature space is not linear separable, support vector machines can produce a nonlinear boundaries using the so-called \"kernel trick\", in which we transform the feature space into a large but linear separable feature space.

    "With the predefined functions above, you will now import the three supervised learning models of your choice and run the `train_predict` function for each one. Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",

    " - **Note:** Use the default settings for each model — you will tune one specific model in a later section.\n",

    "I compared the performance of 3 different models, including Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classifier and Support Vector Machines(SVM) Classifier. Among them, SVM has the highest test F1 score. Decision Tree Classifier shows a sign of overfitting, in which it performs extremely well at the training set but fails to generalize to the testing set.\n",
    "Gaussian Naive Bayes shows some unstable behaviour for the small training set size but performs relatively well for the large training set size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance is not the only thing we need to concern. Training a SVM takes more time the other two models (~ 2-3 times longer). This really depends on the training size and the computational resources. But the performance is still a very important factor because bad performance will lead to more false classifications, which may cost a lot of resources in the student intervention processes. On balance, I choose SVM as our final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that the python timer which implemented here has some strange behaviour. e.g. when I run the code second time, the exact time for training and testing maybe different but the SVM is the most computational expensive one in general. I guess the problem is due to the timer's percision. Any explanations will be highly appreciated.\n",
    "\n",
    "To take a close look at the performance of the SVM, I plot the confusion matrix. The model tends to be very conservative indicated by the fact that most of the misclassified lables are students who do not need intervention but the model actually suggests intervention."

    "In general, the model is trained with information we know about previous student who passed/failed, and then used to predict the outcomes for the new students.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SVM takes information about past students (age, gender, activities, etc), and uses them to create a function that draws a boundary between the students who passed and those who failed. The boundary should be drawn so as to maximize the margin between the students who passed or failed. Using this function created with students we already know passed or not, the SVM can look at new students' information and predict based on their positions relative to the trained boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, it is not easy to draw a boundary directly in low dimensions. The SVM separates the students who passed or failed by first transforming the data points into a high dimensional easy separable space, performing the separation and then transforming back. SVMs have a number of real world applications, such as text recognition, hand-written characters recognition and so on.\n"
